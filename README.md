Geocoding resources for Bulgaria
==================

This is a collection of resources that should help anyone working with geocoding or mapping data in Bulgaria.


Note from the creator of [the current fork](https://github.com/velosofist/Bulgaria-geocoding-kml)
------------------
I don't make any claims of accuracy and relevancy of the included data, as the [original repository](https://github.com/yurukov/Bulgaria-geocoding) was mostly maintained in the years 2015-2016. The province names in /kml/provincesnames.kml were added by me based on [this document](https://www.nsi.bg/file/23721/ATTD_RB_2021_3IUPDJ1.pdf) from the National Statistical Institute. 

Conversion into KML
------------------
[GeoJson.io](https://geojson.io) and [Google My Maps](https://mymaps.google.com) used for conversion and formatting.
A clean-up of the formatting is then needed to remove unnecessary duplicate descriptions with some regexes, e.g. in VSCode's find-and-replace:
- `.*CDATA.*\n` -> blank
- `.*styleUrl.*\n` -> blank
- `.*<Style id[\s\S\n]*?</StyleMap>.*\n` -> blank

municipalities.csv
------------------
A list with all municipalities
- EKATTE - Bulgarian region coding system
- code - classification by the Statistics office

settlements.geojson
------------------
![settlements.geojson](screenshots/settlements.geojson.png)

This is a simplified version of the territorial separation of Bulgaria among the grounds of settlements. While some settlements don't have assigned grounds, they reside inside the grounds of other settlements. In such cases they would be listed in the "contains" array property.
The shapes do not reflect accurately the actual grounds or their overall size. They do match them within reasonable margin of error, which would be enough for most visualization purposes. More accurate maps can be obtained from the national Cadastre office.
